This was an exercise from a work project to try and make a Validator library that took advantage of [procedural macros](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html) in Rust.

Right now this is just a small lib exercise to show that I can do these kinds of things. Its very much a WIP and big props to [keats](https://github.com/Keats/validator) for the inspiration to try and make one of my own.
